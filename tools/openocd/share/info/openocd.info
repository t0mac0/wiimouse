About
*****

The Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) aims to provide debugging,
in-system programming and boundary-scan testing for embedded target
devices. The targets are interfaced using JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) compliant
hardware, but this may be extended to other connection types in the
future.

   OpenOCD currently supports Wiggler (clones), FTDI FT2232 based JTAG
interfaces, the Amontec JTAG Accelerator, and the Gateworks GW1602. It
allows ARM7 (ARM7TDMI and ARM720t), ARM9 (ARM920t, ARM922t, ARM926ej-s,
ARM966e-s), XScale (PXA25x, IXP42x) and Cortex-M3 (Luminary Stellaris
LM3 and ST STM32) based cores to be debugged.

   Flash writing is supported for external CFI compatible flashes
(Intel and AMD/Spansion command set) and several internal flashes
(LPC2000, AT91SAM7, STR7x, STR9x, LM3 and STM32x). Preliminary support
for using the LPC3180's NAND flash controller is included.

**********

You can download the current SVN version with SVN client of your choice
from the following repositories:

   (`svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk')

   or

   (`http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openocd/trunk')

   Using the SVN command line client, you can use the following command
to fetch the latest version (make sure there is no (non-svn) directory
called "openocd" in the current directory):

      svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk openocd

   Building OpenOCD requires a recent version of the GNU autotools.  On
my build system, I'm using autoconf 2.13 and automake 1.9. For building
on Windows, you have to use Cygwin. Make sure that your `PATH'
environment variable contains no other locations with Unix utils (like
UnxUtils) - these can't handle the Cygwin paths, resulting in obscure
dependency errors (This is an observation I've gathered from the logs
of one user - correct me if I'm wrong).

   You further need the appropriate driver files, if you want to build
support for a FTDI FT2232 based interface:
   * ftdi2232 libftdi (`http://www.intra2net.com/opensource/ftdi/')

   * ftd2xx libftd2xx (`http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm')

   * When using the Amontec JTAGkey, you have to get the drivers from
     the Amontec homepage (`www.amontec.com'), as the JTAGkey uses a
     non-standard VID/PID.

   libftdi is supported under windows. Versions earlier than 0.13 will
require patching.  see contrib/libftdi for more details.

   In general, the D2XX driver provides superior performance (several
times as fast), but has the draw-back of being binary-only - though
that isn't that bad, as it isn't a kernel module, only a user space
library.

   To build OpenOCD (on both Linux and Cygwin), use the following
commands:
      ./bootstrap
   Bootstrap generates the configure script, and prepares building on
your system.
      ./configure
   Configure generates the Makefiles used to build OpenOCD.
      make
   Make builds OpenOCD, and places the final executable in ./src/.

   The configure script takes several options, specifying which JTAG
interfaces should be included:

   * `--enable-parport'

   * `--enable-parport_ppdev'

   * `--enable-parport_giveio'

   * `--enable-amtjtagaccel'

   * `--enable-ft2232_ftd2xx' (1)

   * `--enable-ft2232_libftdi'

   * `--with-ftd2xx=/path/to/d2xx/'

   * `--enable-gw16012'

   * `--enable-usbprog'

   * `--enable-presto_libftdi'

   * `--enable-presto_ftd2xx'

   * `--enable-jlink'

   If you want to access the parallel port using the PPDEV interface
you have to specify both the `--enable-parport' AND the
`--enable-parport_ppdev' option since the `--enable-parport_ppdev'
option actually is an option to the parport driver (see
`http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=3795' for more info).

   Cygwin users have to specify the location of the FTDI D2XX package.
This should be an absolute path containing no spaces.

   Linux users should copy the various parts of the D2XX package to the
appropriate locations, i.e. /usr/include, /usr/lib.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Using the latest D2XX drivers from FTDI and following their
installation instructions, I had to use `--enable-ft2232_libftd2xx' for
OpenOCD to build properly.

3 Running
*********

OpenOCD runs as a daemon, waiting for connections from clients (Telnet
or GDB).  Run with `--help' or `-h' to view the available command line
switches.

   It reads its configuration by default from the file openocd.cfg
located in the current working directory. This may be overwritten with
the `-f <configfile>' command line switch.  The `-f' command line
switch can be specified multiple times, in which case the config files
are executed in order.

   Also it is possible to interleave commands w/config scripts using
the `-c' command line switch.

   To enable debug output (when reporting problems or working on
OpenOCD itself), use the `-d' command line switch. This sets the
debug_level to "3", outputting the most information, including debug
messages. The default setting is "2", outputting only informational
messages, warnings and errors. You can also change this setting from
within a telnet or gdb session (`debug_level <n>').

   You can redirect all output from the daemon to a file using the `-l
<logfile>' switch.

   Search paths for config/script files can be added to OpenOCD by using
the `-s <search>' switch. The current directory and the OpenOCD target
library is in the search path by default.

   Note! OpenOCD will launch the GDB & telnet server even if it can not
establish a connection with the target. In general, it is possible for
the JTAG controller to be unresponsive until the target is set up
correctly via e.g. GDB monitor commands in a GDB init script.

4 Configuration
***************

OpenOCD runs as a daemon, and reads it current configuration by default
from the file openocd.cfg in the current directory. A different
configuration file can be specified with the  `-f <conf.file>' command
line switch specified when starting OpenOCD.

   The configuration file is used to specify on which ports the daemon
listens for new connections, the JTAG interface used to connect to the
target, the layout of the JTAG chain, the targets that should be
debugged, and connected flashes.

4.1 Daemon configuration
========================

   * init This command terminates the configuration stage and enters
     the normal command mode. This can be useful to add commands to the
     startup scripts and commands such as resetting the target,
     programming flash, etc. To reset the CPU upon startup, add "init"
     and "reset" at the end of the config script or at the end of the
     OpenOCD command line using the `-c' command line switch.  

   * telnet_port <NUMBER> Port on which to listen for incoming telnet
     connections

   * gdb_port <NUMBER> First port on which to listen for incoming GDB
     connections. The GDB port for the first target will be gdb_port,
     the second target will listen on gdb_port + 1, and so on.

   * gdb_detach <RESUME|RESET|HALT|NOTHING> Configures what OpenOCD
     will do when gdb detaches from the daeman.  Default behaviour is
     <RESUME>

   * gdb_memory_map <ENABLE|DISABLE> Set to <ENABLE> to cause OpenOCD
     to send the memory configuration to gdb when requested. gdb will
     then know when to set hardware breakpoints, and program flash
     using the gdb load command. `gdb_flash_program enable' will also
     need enabling for flash programming to work.  Default behaviour is
     <ENABLE>

   * gdb_flash_program <ENABLE|DISABLE> Set to <ENABLE> to cause
     OpenOCD to program the flash memory when a vFlash packet is
     received.  Default behaviour is <ENABLE>

   * daemon_startup <MODE> `mode' can either `attach' or `reset' This
     is equivalent to adding "init" and "reset" to the end of the
     config script.

     It is available as a command mainly for backwards compatibility.

4.2 JTAG interface configuration
================================

   * interface <NAME> Use the interface driver <NAME> to connect to the
     target. Currently supported interfaces are
        - parport PC parallel port bit-banging (Wigglers, PLD download
          cable, ...)

        - amt_jtagaccel Amontec Chameleon in its JTAG Accelerator
          configuration connected to a PC's EPP mode parallel port

        - ft2232 FTDI FT2232 based devices using either the open-source
          libftdi or the binary only FTD2XX driver. The FTD2XX is
          superior in performance, but not available on every platform.
          The libftdi uses libusb, and should be portable to all
          systems that provide libusb.

        - ep93xx Cirrus Logic EP93xx based single-board computer
          bit-banging (in development)

        - presto ASIX PRESTO USB JTAG programmer.

        - usbprog usbprog is a freely programmable USB adapter.

        - gw16012 Gateworks GW16012 JTAG programmer.

        - jlink Segger jlink usb adapter

   * jtag_speed <RESET SPEED> <POST RESET SPEED> Limit the maximum
     speed of the JTAG interface. Usually, a value of zero means maximum
     speed. The actual effect of this option depends on the JTAG
     interface used. Reset speed is used during reset and post reset
     speed after reset. post reset speed is optional, in which case the
     reset speed is used.
        - wiggler: maximum speed / NUMBER

        - ft2232: 6MHz / (NUMBER+1)

        - amt jtagaccel: 8 / 2**NUMBER

        - jlink: maximum speed in kHz (0-12000), 0 will use RTCK

     Note: Make sure the jtag clock is no more than 1/6th × CPU-Clock.
     This is especially true for synthesized cores (-S).

   * jtag_khz <RESET SPEED KHZ>  <POST RESET SPEED KHZ> Same as
     jtag_speed, except that the speed is specified in maximum kHz. If
     the device can not support the rate asked for, or can not
     translate from kHz to jtag_speed, then an error is returned. 0
     means RTCK. If RTCK is not supported, then an error is reported.

   * reset_config <SIGNALS> [COMBINATION] [TRST_TYPE] [SRST_TYPE] The
     configuration of the reset signals available on the JTAG interface
     AND the target.  If the JTAG interface provides SRST, but the
     target doesn't connect that signal properly, then OpenOCD can't
     use it. <SIGNALS> can be `none', `trst_only', `srst_only' or
     `trst_and_srst'.

     [COMBINATION] is an optional value specifying broken reset signal
     implementations.  `srst_pulls_trst' states that the testlogic is
     reset together with the reset of the system (e.g. Philips LPC2000,
     "broken" board layout), `trst_pulls_srst' says that the system is
     reset together with the test logic (only hypothetical, I haven't
     seen hardware with such a bug, and can be worked around).
     `combined' imples both `srst_pulls_trst' and `trst_pulls_srst'.
     The default behaviour if no option given is `separate'.

     The [TRST_TYPE] and [SRST_TYPE] parameters allow the driver type
     of the reset lines to be specified. Possible values are
     `trst_push_pull' (default) and `trst_open_drain' for the test
     reset signal, and `srst_open_drain' (default) and `srst_push_pull'
     for the system reset. These values only affect JTAG interfaces
     with support for different drivers, like the Amontec JTAGkey and
     JTAGAccelerator.

   * jtag_device <IR LENGTH> <IR CAPTURE> <IR MASK> <IDCODE INSTRUCTION> Describes
     the devices that form the JTAG daisy chain, with the first device
     being the one closest to TDO. The parameters are the length of the
     instruction register (4 for all ARM7/9s), the value captured
     during Capture-IR (0x1 for ARM7/9), and a mask of bits that should
     be validated when doing IR scans (all four bits (0xf) for ARM7/9).
     The IDCODE instruction will in future be used to query devices for
     their JTAG identification code. This line is the same for all ARM7
     and ARM9 devices.  Other devices, like CPLDs, require different
     parameters. An example configuration line for a Xilinx XC9500 CPLD
     would look like this:
          jtag_device 8 0x01 0x0e3 0xfe
     The instruction register (IR) is 8 bits long, during Capture-IR
     0x01 is loaded into the IR, but only bits 0-1 and 5-7 should be
     checked, the others (2-4) might vary.  The IDCODE instruction is
     0xfe.

   * jtag_nsrst_delay <MS> How long (in milliseconds) OpenOCD should
     wait after deasserting nSRST before starting new JTAG operations.

   * jtag_ntrst_delay <MS> How long (in milliseconds) OpenOCD should
     wait after deasserting nTRST before starting new JTAG operations.

     The jtag_n[st]rst_delay options are useful if reset circuitry
     (like a reset supervisor, or on-chip features) keep a reset line
     asserted for some time after the external reset got deasserted.

4.3 parport options
===================

   * parport_port <NUMBER> Either the address of the I/O port (default:
     0x378 for LPT1) or the number of the `/dev/parport' device

     When using PPDEV to access the parallel port, use the number of
     the parallel port: `parport_port 0' (the default). If
     `parport_port 0x378' is specified you may encounter a problem.

   * parport_cable <NAME> The layout of the parallel port cable used to
     connect to the target.  Currently supported cables are
        - wiggler The original Wiggler layout, also supported by
          several clones, such as the Olimex ARM-JTAG

        - old_amt_wiggler The Wiggler configuration that comes with
          Amontec's Chameleon Programmer. The new version available
          from the website uses the original Wiggler layout ('WIGGLER')

        - chameleon The Amontec Chameleon's CPLD when operated in
          configuration mode. This is only used to program the
          Chameleon itself, not a connected target.

        - dlc5 The Xilinx Parallel cable III.

        - triton The parallel port adapter found on the 'Karo Triton 1
          Development Board'.  This is also the layout used by the
          HollyGates design (see
          `http://www.lartmaker.nl/projects/jtag/').

        - flashlink The ST Parallel cable.

   * parport_write_on_exit <ON|OFF> This will configure the parallel
     driver to write a known value to the parallel interface on exiting
     OpenOCD

4.4 amt_jtagaccel options
=========================

   * parport_port <NUMBER> Either the address of the I/O port (default:
     0x378 for LPT1) or the number of the `/dev/parport' device

4.5 ft2232 options
==================

   * ft2232_device_desc <DESCRIPTION> The USB device description of the
     FTDI FT2232 device. If not specified, the FTDI default value is
     used. This setting is only valid if compiled with FTD2XX support.

   * ft2232_layout <NAME> The layout of the FT2232 GPIO signals used to
     control output-enables and reset signals. Valid layouts are
        - usbjtag "USBJTAG-1" layout described in the original OpenOCD
          diploma thesis

        - jtagkey Amontec JTAGkey and JTAGkey-tiny

        - signalyzer Signalyzer

        - olimex-jtag Olimex ARM-USB-OCD

        - m5960 American Microsystems M5960

        - evb_lm3s811 Luminary Micro EVB_LM3S811 as a JTAG interface
          (not onboard processor), no TRST or SRST signals on external
          connector

        - comstick Hitex STR9 comstick

        - stm32stick Hitex STM32 Performance Stick

        - flyswatter Tin Can Tools Flyswatter

        - turtelizer2 egnite Software turtelizer2

        - oocdlink OOCDLink

   * ft2232_vid_pid <VID> <PID> The vendor ID and product ID of the
     FTDI FT2232 device. If not specified, the FTDI default values are
     used. Multiple <VID>, <PID> pairs may be given, eg.
          ft2232_vid_pid 0x0403 0xcff8 0x15ba 0x0003

   * ft2232_latency <MS> On some systems using ft2232 based JTAG
     interfaces the FT_Read function call in ft2232_read() fails to
     return the expected number of bytes. This can be caused by USB
     communication delays and has proved hard to reproduce and debug.
     Setting the FT2232 latency timer to a larger value increases
     delays for short USB packages but it also reduces the risk of
     timeouts before receiving the expected number of bytes.  The
     OpenOCD default value is 2 and for some systems a value of 10 has
     proved useful.

4.6 ep93xx options
==================

Currently, there are no options available for the ep93xx interface.

4.7 Target configuration
========================

   * target <TYPE> <ENDIANESS> <RESET_MODE> <JTAG POS> <VARIANT> Defines
     a target that should be debugged. Currently supported types are:
        - arm7tdmi

        - arm720t

        - arm9tdmi

        - arm920t

        - arm922t

        - arm926ejs

        - arm966e

        - cortex_m3

        - feroceon

        - xscale

     If you want to use a target board that is not on this list, see
     Adding a new target board

     Endianess may be `little' or `big'.

     The reset_mode specifies what should happen to the target when a
     reset occurs:
        - reset_halt Immediately request a target halt after reset.
          This allows targets to be debugged from the very first
          instruction. This is only possible with targets and JTAG
          interfaces that correctly implement the reset signals.

        - reset_init Similar to `reset_halt', but executes the script
          file defined to handle the 'reset' event for the target. Like
          `reset_halt' this only works with correct reset
          implementations.

        - reset_run Simply let the target run after a reset.

        - run_and_halt Let the target run for some time (default: 1s),
          and then request halt.

        - run_and_init A combination of `reset_init' and
          `run_and_halt'. The target is allowed to run for some time,
          then halted, and the `reset' event script is executed.

     On JTAG interfaces / targets where system reset and test-logic
     reset can't be driven completely independent (like the LPC2000
     series), or where the JTAG interface is unavailable for some time
     during startup (like the STR7 series), you can't use `reset_halt'
     or `reset_init'.

   * target_script <TARGET#> <EVENT> <SCRIPT_FILE> Event is either
     `reset', `post_halt', `pre_resume' or `gdb_program_config'

     TODO: describe exact semantic of events

   * run_and_halt_time <TARGET#> <TIME_IN_MS> The amount of time the
     debugger should wait after releasing reset before it asserts a
     debug request. This is used by the `run_and_halt' and
     `run_and_init' reset modes.

   * working_area <TARGET#> <ADDRESS> <SIZE> <BACKUP|NOBACKUP> Specifies
     a working area for the debugger to use. This may be used to
     speed-up downloads to target memory and flash operations, or to
     perform otherwise unavailable operations (some coprocessor
     operations on ARM7/9 systems, for example). The last parameter
     decides whether the memory should be preserved (<BACKUP>) or can
     simply be overwritten (<NOBACKUP>). If possible, use a
     working_area that doesn't need to be backed up, as performing a
     backup slows down operation.

4.7.1 arm7tdmi options
----------------------

target arm7tdmi <ENDIANESS> <RESET_MODE> <JTAG#> The arm7tdmi target
definition requires at least one additional argument, specifying the
position of the target in the JTAG daisy-chain. The first JTAG device
is number 0.  The optional [VARIANT] parameter has been removed in
recent versions.  The correct feature set is determined at runtime.

4.7.2 arm720t options
---------------------

ARM720t options are similar to ARM7TDMI options.

4.7.3 arm9tdmi options
----------------------

ARM9TDMI options are similar to ARM7TDMI options. Supported variants are
`arm920t', `arm922t' and `arm940t'.  This enables the hardware
single-stepping support found on these cores.

4.7.4 arm920t options
---------------------

ARM920t options are similar to ARM9TDMI options.

4.7.5 arm966e options
---------------------

ARM966e options are similar to ARM9TDMI options.

4.7.6 cortex_m3 options
-----------------------

use variant <VARIANT> `lm3s' when debugging luminary lm3s targets. This
will cause openocd to use a software reset rather than asserting SRST
to avoid a issue with clearing the debug registers. This is fixed in
Fury Rev B, DustDevil Rev B, Tempest, these revisions will be detected
and the normal reset behaviour used.

4.7.7 xscale options
--------------------

Supported variants are `ixp42x', `ixp45x', `ixp46x', `pxa250',
`pxa255', `pxa26x'.

4.8 Flash configuration
=======================

   * flash bank <DRIVER> <BASE> <SIZE> <CHIP_WIDTH> <BUS_WIDTH>
     <TARGET#> [DRIVER_OPTIONS ...]  Configures a flash bank at <BASE>
     of <SIZE> bytes and <CHIP_WIDTH> and <BUS_WIDTH> bytes using the
     selected flash <driver>.

4.8.1 lpc2000 options
---------------------

flash bank lpc2000 <BASE> <SIZE> 0 0 <TARGET#> <VARIANT> <CLOCK>
[CALC_CHECKSUM] LPC flashes don't require the chip and bus width to be
specified. Additional parameters are the <VARIANT>, which may be
LPC2000_V1 (older LPC21xx and LPC22xx) or LPC2000_V2 (LPC213x, LPC214x,
LPC210[123], LPC23xx and LPC24xx), the number of the target this flash
belongs to (first is 0), the frequency at which the core is currently
running (in kHz - must be an integral number), and the optional keyword
CALC_CHECKSUM, telling the driver to calculate a valid checksum for the
exception vector table.

4.8.2 cfi options
-----------------

flash bank cfi <BASE> <SIZE> <CHIP_WIDTH> <BUS_WIDTH> <TARGET#> CFI
flashes require the number of the target they're connected to as an
additional argument. The CFI driver makes use of a working area
(specified for the target) to significantly speed up operation.

   CHIP_WIDTH and BUS_WIDTH are specified in bytes.

4.8.3 at91sam7 options
----------------------

flash bank at91sam7 0 0 0 0 <TARGET#> AT91SAM7 flashes only require the
TARGET#, all other values are looked up after reading the chip-id and
type.

4.8.4 str7 options
------------------

flash bank str7x <BASE> <SIZE> 0 0 <TARGET#> <VARIANT> variant can be
either STR71x, STR73x or STR75x.

4.8.5 str9 options
------------------

flash bank str9x <BASE> <SIZE> 0 0 <TARGET#> The str9 needs the flash
controller to be configured prior to Flash programming, eg.
     str9x flash_config 0 4 2 0 0x80000
   This will setup the BBSR, NBBSR, BBADR and NBBADR registers
respectively.

4.8.6 str9 options (str9xpec driver)
------------------------------------

flash bank str9xpec <BASE> <SIZE> 0 0 <TARGET#> Before using the flash
commands the turbo mode will need enabling using str9xpec
`enable_turbo' <NUM>.

   Only use this driver for locking/unlocking the device or configuring
the option bytes.  Use the standard str9 driver for programming.

4.8.7 stellaris (LM3Sxxx) options
---------------------------------

flash bank stellaris <BASE> <SIZE> 0 0 <TARGET#> stellaris flash plugin
only require the TARGET#.

4.8.8 stm32x options
--------------------

flash bank stm32x <BASE> <SIZE> 0 0 <TARGET#> stm32x flash plugin only
require the TARGET#.

5 Target library
****************

OpenOCD comes with a target configuration script library. These scripts
can be used as-is or serve as a starting point.

   The target library is published together with the openocd executable
and the path to the target library is in the OpenOCD script search path.
Similarly there are example scripts for configuring the JTAG interface.

   The command line below uses the example parport configuration scripts
that ship with OpenOCD, then configures the str710.cfg target and
finally issues the init and reset command. The communication speed is
set to 10kHz for reset and 8MHz for post reset.

     openocd -f interface/parport.cfg -c "jtag_khz 10 8000" -f target/str710.cfg -c "init" -c "reset"

   To list the target scripts available:

     $ ls  /usr/local/lib/openocd/target

     arm7_fast.cfg    lm3s6965.cfg  pxa255.cfg      stm32.cfg   xba_revA3.cfg
     at91eb40a.cfg    lpc2148.cfg   pxa255_sst.cfg  str710.cfg  zy1000.cfg
     at91r40008.cfg   lpc2294.cfg   sam7s256.cfg    str912.cfg
     at91sam9260.cfg  nslu2.cfg     sam7x256.cfg    wi-9c.cfg

6 Commands
**********

OpenOCD allows user interaction through a telnet interface (default:
port 4444) and a GDB server (default: port 3333). The command line
interpreter is available from both the telnet interface and a GDB
session. To issue commands to the interpreter from within a GDB
session, use the `monitor' command, e.g. use `monitor poll' to issue
the `poll' command. All output is relayed through the GDB session.

6.1 Daemon
==========

   * sleep <MSEC> Wait for n milliseconds before resuming. Useful in
     connection with script files (SCRIPT command and TARGET_SCRIPT
     configuration).

   * shutdown Close the OpenOCD daemon, disconnecting all clients (GDB,
     Telnet).

   * debug_level [N] Display or adjust debug level to n<0-3>

   * fast [ENABLE/DISABLE] Default disabled. Set default behaviour of
     OpenOCD to be "fast and dangerous". For instance ARM7/9 DCC memory
     downloads and fast memory access will work if the JTAG interface
     isn't too fast and the core doesn't run at a too low frequency.
     Note that this option only changes the default and that the
     indvidual options, like DCC memory downloads, can be enabled and
     disabled individually.

     The target specific "dangerous" optimisation tweaking options may
     come and go as more robust and user friendly ways are found to
     ensure maximum throughput and robustness with a minimum of
     configuration.

     Typically the "fast enable" is specified first on the command line:

          openocd -c "fast enable" -c "interface dummy" -f target/str710.cfg

   * log_output <FILE> Redirect logging to <file> (default: stderr)

   * script <FILE> Execute commands from <file>


6.1.1 Target state handling
---------------------------

   * poll [`on'|`off'] Poll the target for its current state. If the
     target is in debug mode, architecture specific information about
     the current state is printed. An optional parameter allows
     continuous polling to be enabled and disabled.

   * halt [`ms'] Send a halt request to the target and wait for it to
     halt for up to [`ms'] milliseconds.  Default [`ms'] is 5 seconds
     if no arg given.  Optional arg `ms' is a timeout in milliseconds.
     Using 0 as the [`ms'] will stop OpenOCD from waiting.

   * wait_halt [`ms'] Wait for the target to enter debug mode. Optional
     [`ms'] is a timeout in milliseconds. Default [`ms'] is 5 seconds
     if no arg given.

   * resume [ADDRESS] Resume the target at its current code position,
     or at an optional address.  OpenOCD will wait 5 seconds for the
     target to resume.

   * step [ADDRESS] Single-step the target at its current code
     position, or at an optional address.

   * reset [`run'|`halt'|`init'|`run_and_halt' |`run_and_init'] Perform
     a hard-reset. The optional parameter specifies what should happen
     after the reset.  This optional parameter overrides the setting
     specified in the configuration file, making the new behaviour the
     default for the `reset' command.
        - run Let the target run.

        - halt Immediately halt the target (works only with certain
          configurations).

        - init Immediately halt the target, and execute the reset
          script (works only with certain configurations)

        - run_and_halt Let the target run for a certain amount of time,
          then request a halt.

        - run_and_init Let the target run for a certain amount of time,
          then request a halt. Execute the reset script once the target
          enters debug mode.

6.1.2 Memory access commands
----------------------------

These commands allow accesses of a specific size to the memory system:
   * mdw <ADDR> [COUNT] display memory words

   * mdh <ADDR> [COUNT] display memory half-words

   * mdb <ADDR> [COUNT] display memory bytes

   * mww <ADDR> <VALUE> write memory word

   * mwh <ADDR> <VALUE> write memory half-word

   * mwb <ADDR> <VALUE> write memory byte

   * load_image <FILE> <ADDRESS> [`bin'|`ihex'|`elf'] Load image <FILE>
     to target memory at <ADDRESS>

   * dump_image <FILE> <ADDRESS> <SIZE> Dump <SIZE> bytes of target
     memory starting at <ADDRESS> to a (binary) <FILE>.

   * verify_image <FILE> <ADDRESS> [`bin'|`ihex'|`elf'] Verify <FILE>
     against target memory starting at <ADDRESS>.  This will first
     attempt comparison using a crc checksum, if this fails it will try
     a binary compare.

6.1.3 Flash commands
--------------------

   * flash banks List configured flash banks

   * flash info <NUM> Print info about flash bank <`num'>

   * flash probe <NUM> Identify the flash, or validate the parameters
     of the configured flash. Operation depends on the flash type.

   * flash erase_check <NUM> Check erase state of sectors in flash bank
     <NUM>. This is the only operation that updates the erase state
     information displayed by `flash info'. That means you have to
     issue an `erase_check' command after erasing or programming the
     device to get updated information.

   * flash protect_check <NUM> Check protection state of sectors in
     flash bank <num>.  `flash erase_sector' using the same syntax.

   * flash erase_sector <NUM> <FIRST> <LAST> Erase sectors at bank
     <NUM>, starting at sector <FIRST> up to and including <LAST>.
     Sector numbering starts at 0. Depending on the flash type, erasing
     may require the protection to be disabled first (e.g. Intel
     Advanced Bootblock flash using the CFI driver).

   * flash erase_address <ADDRESS> <LENGTH> Erase sectors starting at
     <ADDRESS> for <LENGTH> bytes

   * flash write_bank <NUM> <FILE> <OFFSET> Write the binary <FILE> to
     flash bank <NUM>, starting at <`offset'> bytes from the beginning
     of the bank.

   * flash write_image [ERASE] <FILE> [OFFSET] [TYPE] Write the image
     <FILE> to the current target's flash bank(s). A relocation
     [OFFSET] can be specified and the file [TYPE] can be specified
     explicitly as `bin' (binary), `ihex' (Intel hex), `elf' (ELF file)
     or `s19' (Motorola s19). Flash memory will be erased prior to
     programming if the `erase' parameter is given.

   * flash protect <NUM> <FIRST> <LAST> <`on'|`off'> Enable (ON) or
     disable (OFF) protection of flash sectors <FIRST> to <LAST> of
     `flash bank' <NUM>.

6.2 Target Specific Commands
============================

6.2.1 AT91SAM7 specific commands
--------------------------------

The flash configuration is deduced from the chip identification
register. The flash controller handles erases automatically on a page
(128/265 byte) basis so erase is not necessary for flash programming.
AT91SAM7 processors with less than 512K flash only have a single flash
bank embedded on chip. AT91SAM7xx512 have two flash planes that can be
erased separatly. Only an EraseAll command is supported by the
controller for each flash plane and this is called with
   * flash erase <NUM> FIRST_PLANE LAST_PLANE bulk erase flash planes
     first_plane to last_plane.

   * at91sam7 gpnvm <NUM> <BIT> <`set'|`clear'> set or clear a gpnvm
     bit for the processor

6.2.2 STR9 specific commands
----------------------------

These are flash specific commands when using the str9xpec driver.
   * str9xpec enable_turbo <NUM> enable turbo mode, simply this will
     remove the str9 from the chain and talk directly to the embedded
     flash controller.

   * str9xpec disable_turbo <NUM> restore the str9 into jtag chain.

   * str9xpec lock <NUM> lock str9 device. The str9 will only respond
     to an unlock command that will erase the device.

   * str9xpec unlock <NUM> unlock str9 device.

   * str9xpec options_read <NUM> read str9 option bytes.

   * str9xpec options_write <NUM> write str9 option bytes.

6.2.3 STR9 configuration
------------------------

   * str9x flash_config <BANK> <BBSR> <NBBSR> <BBADR> <NBBADR> Configure
     str9 flash controller.
          eg. str9x flash_config 0 4 2 0 0x80000
          This will setup
          BBSR - Boot Bank Size register
          NBBSR - Non Boot Bank Size register
          BBADR - Boot Bank Start Address register
          NBBADR - Boot Bank Start Address register

6.2.4 STR9 option byte configuration
------------------------------------

   * str9xpec options_cmap <NUM> <`bank0'|`bank1'> configure str9 boot
     bank.

   * str9xpec options_lvdthd <NUM> <`2.4v'|`2.7v'> configure str9 lvd
     threshold.

   * str9xpec options_lvdsel <NUM> <`vdd'|`vdd_vddq'> configure str9
     lvd source.

   * stm32x lock <NUM> lock stm32 device.

   * stm32x unlock <NUM> unlock stm32 device.

   * stm32x options_read <NUM> read stm32 option bytes.

   * stm32x options_write <NUM> <`SWWDG'|`HWWDG'>

     option bytes.

   * stm32x mass_erase <NUM> mass erase flash memory.

6.2.6 Stellaris specific commands
---------------------------------

These are flash specific commands when using the Stellaris driver.
   * stellaris mass_erase <NUM> mass erase flash memory.

6.3 Architecture Specific Commands
==================================

6.3.1 ARMV4/5 specific commands
-------------------------------

These commands are specific to ARM architecture v4 and v5, like all
ARM7/9 systems or Intel XScale (XScale isn't supported yet).
   * armv4_5 reg Display a list of all banked core registers, fetching
     the current value from every core mode if necessary. OpenOCD
     versions before rev. 60 didn't fetch the current register value.

   * armv4_5 core_mode [ARM|THUMB] Displays the core_mode, optionally
     changing it to either ARM or Thumb mode.  The target is resumed in
     the currently set `core_mode'.

6.3.2 ARM7/9 specific commands
------------------------------

These commands are specific to ARM7 and ARM9 targets, like ARM7TDMI,
ARM720t, ARM920t or ARM926EJ-S.
   * arm7_9 sw_bkpts <ENABLE|DISABLE> Enable/disable use of software
     breakpoints. On ARMv4 systems, this reserves one of the watchpoint
     registers to implement software breakpoints. Disabling SW Bkpts
     frees that register again.

   * arm7_9 force_hw_bkpts <ENABLE|DISABLE> When `force_hw_bkpts' is
     enabled, the `sw_bkpts' support is disabled, and all breakpoints
     are turned into hardware breakpoints.

   * arm7_9 dbgrq <ENABLE|DISABLE> Enable use of the DBGRQ bit to force
     entry into debug mode. This should be safe for all but ARM7TDMI-S
     cores (like Philips LPC).

   * arm7_9 fast_memory_access <ENABLE|DISABLE> Allow OpenOCD to read
     and write memory without checking completion of the operation.
     This provides a huge speed increase, especially with USB JTAG
     cables (FT2232), but might be unsafe if used with targets running
     at a very low speed, like the 32kHz startup clock of an AT91RM9200.

   * arm7_9 dcc_downloads <ENABLE|DISABLE> Enable the use of the debug
     communications channel (DCC) to write larger (>128 byte) amounts
     of memory. DCC downloads offer a huge speed increase, but might be
     potentially unsafe, especially with targets running at a very low
     speed. This command was introduced with OpenOCD rev. 60.

6.3.3 ARM720T specific commands
-------------------------------

   * arm720t cp15 <NUM> [VALUE] display/modify cp15 register <`num'>
     [`value'].

   * arm720t md<bhw>_phys <ADDR> [COUNT] Display memory at physical
     address addr.

   * arm720t mw<bhw>_phys <ADDR> <VALUE> Write memory at physical
     address addr.

   * arm720t virt2phys <VA> Translate a virtual address to a physical
     address.

6.3.4 ARM9TDMI specific commands
--------------------------------

   * arm9tdmi vector_catch <ALL|NONE> Catch arm9 interrupt vectors, can
     be `all' `none' or any of the following: `reset' `undef' `swi'
     `pabt' `dabt' `reserved' `irq' `fiq'.

     Can also be used on other arm9 based cores, arm966, arm920t and
     arm926ejs.

6.3.5 ARM966E specific commands
-------------------------------

   * arm966e cp15 <NUM> [VALUE] display/modify cp15 register <`num'>
     [`value'].

6.3.6 ARM920T specific commands
-------------------------------

   * arm920t cp15 <NUM> [VALUE] display/modify cp15 register <`num'>
     [`value'].

   * arm920t cp15i <NUM> [VALUE] [ADDRESS] display/modify cp15
     (interpreted access) <`opcode'> [`value'] [`address']

   * arm920t cache_info Print information about the caches found. This
     allows you to see if your target is a ARM920T (2x16kByte cache) or
     ARM922T (2x8kByte cache).

   * arm920t md<bhw>_phys <ADDR> [COUNT] Display memory at physical
     address addr.

   * arm920t mw<bhw>_phys <ADDR> <VALUE> Write memory at physical
     address addr.

     to a file.

   * arm920t virt2phys <VA> Translate a virtual address to a physical
     address.

6.3.7 ARM926EJS specific commands
---------------------------------

   * arm926ejs cp15 <NUM> [VALUE] display/modify cp15 register <`num'>
     [`value'].

   * arm926ejs cache_info Print information about the caches found.

   * arm926ejs md<bhw>_phys <ADDR> [COUNT] Display memory at physical
     address addr.

   * arm926ejs mw<bhw>_phys <ADDR> <VALUE> Write memory at physical
     address addr.

   * arm926ejs virt2phys <VA> Translate a virtual address to a physical
     address.

6.4 Debug commands
==================

The following commands give direct access to the core, and are most
likely only useful while debugging OpenOCD.
   * arm7_9 write_xpsr <32-BIT VALUE> <`0=cpsr', `1=spsr'> Immediately
     write either the current program status register (CPSR) or the
     saved program status register (SPSR), without changing the
     register cache (as displayed by the `reg' and `armv4_5 reg'
     commands).

   * arm7_9 write_xpsr_im8 <8-BIT VALUE> <ROTATE 4-BIT> <0=CPSR,1=SPSR> Write
     the 8-bit value rotated right by 2*rotate bits, using an immediate
     write operation (similar to `write_xpsr').

   * arm7_9 write_core_reg <NUM> <MODE> <VALUE> Write a core register,
     without changing the register cache (as displayed by the `reg' and
     `armv4_5 reg' commands). The <MODE> argument takes the encoding of
     the [M4:M0] bits of the PSR.

6.5 JTAG commands
=================

   * scan_chain Print current scan chain configuration.

   * jtag_reset <TRST> <SRST> Toggle reset lines.

   * endstate <TAP_STATE> Finish JTAG operations in <TAP_STATE>.

     delete variable <NAME> [NUM_FIELDS|DEL] [SIZE1] ...

   * field <VAR> <FIELD> [VALUE|FLIP] Display/modify variable field
     <VAR> <FIELD> [VALUE|FLIP].

6.6 Target Requests
===================

OpenOCD can handle certain target requests, currently debugmsg are only
supported for arm7_9 and cortex_m3.  See libdcc in the contrib dir for
more details.
   * target_request debugmsgs <ENABLE|DISABLE> Enable/disable target
     debugmsgs requests. debugmsgs enable messages to be sent to the
     debugger while the target is running.

7 Sample Scripts
****************

This page shows how to use the target library.

   The configuration script can be divided in the following section:
   * daemon configuration

   * interface

   * jtag scan chain

   * target configuration

   * flash configuration

   Detailed information about each section can be found at OpenOCD
configuration.

7.1 AT91R40008 example
======================

To start OpenOCD with a target script for the AT91R40008 CPU and reset
the CPU upon startup of the OpenOCD daemon.
     openocd -f interface/parport.cfg -f target/at91r40008.cfg -c init -c reset

8 GDB and OpenOCD
*****************

OpenOCD complies with the remote gdbserver protocol, and as such can be
used to debug remote targets.

8.1 Connecting to gdb
=====================

A connection is typically started as follows:
     target remote localhost:3333
   This would cause gdb to connect to the gdbserver on the local pc
using port 3333.

   To see a list of available OpenOCD commands type `monitor help' on
the gdb commandline.

   OpenOCD supports the gdb `qSupported' packet, this enables
information to be sent by the gdb server (openocd) to gdb. Typical
information includes packet size and device memory map.

   Previous versions of OpenOCD required the following gdb options to
increase the packet size and speed up gdb communication.
     set remote memory-write-packet-size 1024
     set remote memory-write-packet-size fixed
     set remote memory-read-packet-size 1024
     set remote memory-read-packet-size fixed
   This is now handled in the `qSupported' PacketSize.

8.2 Programming using gdb
=========================

By default the target memory map is sent to gdb, this can be disabled by
the following OpenOCD config option:
     gdb_memory_map disable
   For this to function correctly a valid flash config must also be
configured in OpenOCD. For faster performance you should also configure
a valid working area.

   Informing gdb of the memory map of the target will enable gdb to
protect any flash area of the target and use hardware breakpoints by
default. This means that the OpenOCD option `arm7_9 force_hw_bkpts' is
not required when using a memory map.

   To view the configured memory map in gdb, use the gdb command `info
mem' All other unasigned addresses within gdb are treated as RAM.

   GDB 6.8 and higher set any memory area not in the memory map as
inaccessible, this can be changed to the old behaviour by using the
following gdb command.
     set mem inaccessible-by-default off

   If `gdb_flash_program enable' is also used, gdb will be able to
program any flash memory using the vFlash interface.

   gdb will look at the target memory map when a load command is given,
if any areas to be programmed lie within the target flash area the
vFlash packets will be used.

   If the target needs configuring before gdb programming, a script can
be executed.
     target_script 0 gdb_program_config config.script

   To verify any flash programming the gdb command `compare-sections'
can be used.

10 FAQ
******

  1. OpenOCD complains about a missing cygwin1.dll.

     Make sure you have Cygwin installed, or at least a version of
     OpenOCD that claims to come with all the necessary dlls. When
     using Cygwin, try launching OpenOCD from the Cygwin shell.

  2. I'm trying to set a breakpoint using GDB (or a frontend like
     Insight or Eclipse), but OpenOCD complains that "Info:
     arm7_9_common.c:213 arm7_9_add_breakpoint(): sw breakpoint
     requested, but software breakpoints not enabled".

     GDB issues software breakpoints when a normal breakpoint is
     requested, or to implement source-line single-stepping. On ARMv4T
     systems, like ARM7TDMI, ARM720t or ARM920t, software breakpoints
     consume one of the two available hardware breakpoints, and are
     therefore disabled by default. If your code is running from RAM,
     you can enable software breakpoints with the `arm7_9 sw_bkpts
     enable' command. If your code resides in Flash, you can't use
     software breakpoints, but you can force OpenOCD to use hardware
     breakpoints instead: `arm7_9 force_hw_bkpts enable'.

  3. When erasing or writing LPC2000 on-chip flash, the operation fails
     sometimes and works sometimes fine.

     Make sure the core frequency specified in the `flash lpc2000' line
     matches the clock at the time you're programming the flash. If
     you've specified the crystal's frequency, make sure the PLL is
     disabled, if you've specified the full core speed (e.g. 60MHz),
     make sure the PLL is enabled.

  4. When debugging using an Amontec Chameleon in its JTAG Accelerator
     configuration, I keep getting "Error: amt_jtagaccel.c:184
     amt_wait_scan_busy(): amt_jtagaccel timed out while waiting for
     end of scan, rtck was disabled".

     Make sure your PC's parallel port operates in EPP mode. You might
     have to try several settings in your PC BIOS (ECP, EPP, and
     different versions of those).

  5. When debugging with OpenOCD and GDB (plain GDB, Insight, or
     Eclipse), I get lots of "Error: arm7_9_common.c:1771
     arm7_9_read_memory(): memory read caused data abort".

     The errors are non-fatal, and are the result of GDB trying to
     trace stack frames beyond the last valid frame. It might be
     possible to prevent this by setting up a proper "initial" stack
     frame, if you happen to know what exactly has to be done, feel
     free to add this here.

  6. I get the following message in the OpenOCD console (or log file):
     "Warning: arm7_9_common.c:679 arm7_9_assert_reset(): srst resets
     test logic, too".

     This warning doesn't indicate any serious problem, as long as you
     don't want to debug your core right out of reset. Your .cfg file
     specified `jtag_reset trst_and_srst srst_pulls_trst' to tell
     OpenOCD that either your board, your debugger or your target uC
     (e.g. LPC2000) can't assert the two reset signals independently.
     With this setup, it's not possible to halt the core right out of
     reset, everything else should work fine.

  7. When using OpenOCD in conjunction with Amontec JTAGkey and the
     Yagarto Toolchain (Eclipse, arm-elf-gcc, arm-elf-gdb), the
     debugging seems to be unstable. When single-stepping over large
     blocks of code, GDB and OpenOCD quit with an error message. Is
     there a stability issue with OpenOCD?

     No, this is not a stability issue concerning OpenOCD. Most users
     have solved this issue by simply using a self-powered USB hub,
     which they connect their Amontec JTAGkey to. Apparently, some
     computers do not provide a USB power supply stable enough for the
     Amontec JTAGkey to be operated.

  8. When using the Amontec JTAGkey, sometimes OpenOCD crashes with the
     following error messages: "Error: ft2232.c:201 ft2232_read():
     FT_Read returned: 4" and "Error: ft2232.c:365
     ft2232_send_and_recv(): couldn't read from FT2232".  What does
     that mean and what might be the reason for this?

     First of all, the reason might be the USB power supply. Try using
     a self-powered hub instead of a direct connection to your
     computer. Secondly, the error code 4 corresponds to an
     FT_IO_ERROR, which means that the driver for the FTDI USB chip ran
     into some sort of error - this points us to a USB problem.

  9. When using the Amontec JTAGkey, sometimes OpenOCD crashes with the
     following error message: "Error: gdb_server.c:101 gdb_get_char():
     read: 10054".  What does that mean and what might be the reason
     for this?

     Error code 10054 corresponds to WSAECONNRESET, which means that
     the debugger (GDB) has closed the connection to OpenOCD. This
     might be a GDB issue.

 10. In the configuration file in the section where flash device
     configurations are described, there is a parameter for specifying
     the clock frequency for LPC2000 internal flash devices (e.g.
     `flash bank lpc2000 0x0 0x40000 0 0 0 lpc2000_v1 14746
     calc_checksum'), which must be specified in kilohertz. However, I
     do have a quartz crystal of a frequency that contains fractions of
     kilohertz (e.g. 14,745,600 Hz, i.e. 14,745.600 kHz).  Is it
     possible to specify real numbers for the clock frequency?

     No. The clock frequency specified here must be given as an
     integral number.  However, this clock frequency is used by the
     In-Application-Programming (IAP) routines of the LPC2000 family
     only, which seems to be very tolerant concerning the given clock
     frequency, so a slight difference between the specified clock
     frequency and the actual clock frequency will not cause any
     trouble.

 11. Do I have to keep a specific order for the commands in the
     configuration file?

     Well, yes and no. Commands can be given in arbitrary order, yet
     the devices listed for the JTAG scan chain must be given in the
     right order (jtag_device), with the device closest to the TDO-Pin
     being listed first. In general, whenever objects of the same type
     exist which require an index number, then these objects must be
     given in the right order (jtag_devices, targets and flash banks -
     a target references a jtag_device and a flash bank references a
     target).

 12. Sometimes my debugging session terminates with an error. When I
     look into the log file, I can see these error messages: Error:
     arm7_9_common.c:561 arm7_9_execute_sys_speed(): timeout waiting
     for SYSCOMP

     TODO.

Appendix A The GNU Free Documentation License.
**********************************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
